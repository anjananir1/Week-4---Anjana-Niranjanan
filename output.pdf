- Note: So sorry, I have embedded google docs and screenshots before into github many times but for some reason I 
tried so many times today and it was not working for me so this link above was the best I could do. The link will take you 
to a google doc with the screenshots of my output and the code. 

- If possible, you could copy and paste the link into a google tab or also, my output is below for what the result is. 




In that link you will see that the output states: 

Item: Notebook, Quantity: 10
Item: Pencil, Quantity: 50 
Program ended with exit code: 0
